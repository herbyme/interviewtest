What if a groundbreaking technology could be applied to this phenomenon, he wondered, and the service operated at scale? So he decided to start a ride-sharing company of his own, Zimride, and by some coincidence or fate (O.K., it was a Facebook post that a mutual friend had shared), he was introduced to a guy who could have named the start-up after himself: <strong>John Zimmer.</strong> Zimride eventually rebranded and pivoted to be what’s now known as Lyft.</p>

<p>Lyft, once considered Uber’s little nemesis, is now trying to eat the the $62.5 billion start-up’s lunch. Starting with a $100 million capital infusion by <strong>Carl Icahn</strong> in 2015, Lyft has become a major global competitor and tormentor. Now valued at $5.5 billion, Lyft has partnered with China’s Didi Chuxing, India’s Ola, and Southeast Asia’s Grab, and indirectly forced Uber to keep up in those markets. (Hence the company’s announcement of a recent $3.5 billion investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund.) Lyft also took on a major investment from General Motors earlier this year, and has taken steps toward self-driving cars. </p>

<p>Here, Green and Zimmer speak about a future without car ownership, autonomous driving, gender issues, and their theory about treating drivers right, among other topics.</p>

<p><strong><em>VF.com:</em> What’s your ultimate vision for the future of transportation?</strong></p>

<p><em>Logan Green:</em> The experience we’re seeing today is just the tip of the iceberg. And as autonomous vehicles come to market and become more of a mature technology, the majority of the population, we believe, will stop choosing to own a car. When you imagine the experience of being able to open up the app and choosing whatever type of car you want, the car is 30 seconds away, waiting for you, picks you up in an instant—when you’re going to work you can have the cheap commuter car, when you’re going on a family trip you can have a family Lyft, a big S.U.V., a nice car for date night. You’ll have whatever car you want whenever you want. All the hassles of car ownership go away. You’re never missing a day of work to take your car to the shop. You’re never spending time at a gas station. Parking lots go away. Look at any street and you see cars parked on both sides. That all changes. Ultimately, cities evolve to be built more around people than cars.</p>

<p><em>John Zimmer:</em> That’s what’s most exciting to us. By rebuilding transportation so that you’re not owning this thing that just sits there all the time, you get to rebuild cities in the process. If we do this right as a country, we have a chance to re-create our cities with the people, rather than cars, at the center. Our cities today have been built for the car. They’ve been built for car ownership. Imagine walking around in the city where you don’t see any parking lots and you don’t need that many roads. </p>

<p><strong>How did Lyft’s partnership with GM come about?</strong></p>

<p><em>Zimmer:</em> Dan Ammann, the president of General Motors, came to our office toward the end of last year. They, too, believe that car ownership will change dramatically in the near term, specifically in the urban environment. And they were excited to be part of that. Then I gave a speech at the L.A. Auto Show, titled “The end of car ownership,” about how millennials don’t care about cars and don’t want a $9,000 ball and chain. We had already scheduled a meeting with General Motors for after the talk, and had this second strategic meeting with them about an investment. The investment was made, and it focuses on two areas.</p>

<p><em>Green:</em> The first element is Express Drive, which provides vehicles to drivers. With Express Drive we have 160,000 people who have applied to be Lyft drivers who didn’t have cars that qualified, and Express Drive is about providing a vehicle for them. We launched that three months after we kicked off the partnership in Chicago. </p>

<p>The second piece, which is longer term, is about autonomous. We’re working closely with GM on planning out what the future of autonomous looks like, with the concept that you’d be requesting those vehicles through the Lyft network.</p>

<p><strong>When do you think we’ll see driverless cars?</strong></p>

<p><em>Green:</em> I think they’re going to happen both sooner and longer than a lot of people think. In the next few years you’re going to start seeing autonomous vehicles on the road, but they’ll have limited capabilities. They won’t be able to drive on every street. They won’t be able to drive above 25 miles an hour. They won’t be able to drive in all-weather conditions. It’ll take those cars a number of years to be able to evolve to handle all conditions. It’ll be a while longer before you’re seeing completely capable autonomous vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any tension between Lyft having this fleet of drivers and this future where cars don’t need drivers?</strong></p>

<p><em>Zimmer:</em> Autonomous vehicles, because they’ll be able to operate at a lower cost, will be able to pull more consumers into the Lyft network. And as you have more people switching from using their own car, they’ll be taking more rides that still require a person behind the wheel. We think that in the foreseeable future of the next five-plus years, the number of human drivers we need on the road is going to keep going up. Longer term, of course, when the cars are fully autonomous, there will be a big shift.</p>

<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about Lyft’s global ride-hailing alliance with China’s Didi, India’s Ola, and Southeast Asia’s Grab?</strong></p>

<p><em>Green:</em> We announced this global alliance, and the first piece of that went live a few weeks ago, where Didi users, when they travel to the U.S., open up the Didi app, and can see all of the Lyft cars on the road, and seamlessly use Didi the way they use it all the time—they can use their existing payment mechanisms, existing phone number. They simply request a ride and Lyft, in the background, fulfills that request. Soon, Lyft users traveling to China will be able to open up the Lyft app and overnight we will have better coverage than Uber in China. And when we launch our integrations with Grab and Ola we will have better coverage than Uber across India and Southeast Asia as well. </p>

<p><strong>Half of Lyft’s executives are women. Was this by design or coincidence?</strong></p>

<p><em>Zimmer:</em> We never set any benchmarks or targets. It was never intentional. We just hire the best people. And the best people typically reflect the population. We’re really happy that that has happened naturally—now it kind of continues to feed on itself. Our community of drivers has 30 percent women in a driving industry that’s typically 1 percent. We better understand each other because we better reflect our community than maybe other tech companies or other companies in general. It’s something we’re very happy with and proud of.</p>

<p><strong>How did the investment from Carl Icahn happen?</strong></p>

<p><em>Zimmer:</em> We approached him and pitched him the business. He had been in the auto industry in different ways, through his investment in Hertz and now Autoparts, and we connected with him and wanted to demonstrate that a very savvy New York investor could dig into our numbers and see a massive opportunity, and that’s what he saw, and then he made the investment. He’s been a good partner. </p>

<p><strong>How do you work to become the top choice for someone looking to hail a ride on their phone?</strong></p>

<p><em>Zimmer:</em> We stay true to our values, and that’s very people-centric, and taking care of our drivers, and drivers taking care of our passengers, and what we’re seeing now is a driver preference and a passenger preference for Lyft. Eight out of 10 drivers prefer driving for Lyft. We’ll keep delivering our message. We’ll keep talking about how we want to push forward the future of transportation in a people-centric way, and the narrative has already changed dramatically in the past year, and will continue to change as we continue to tell our story.</p>

<p><strong>Have you ever taken an Uber?</strong></p>

<p><em>Zimmer:</em> Maybe before Lyft launched? But I don’t even remember doing that.</p></span></div>
